1- First, let's make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip, the package installer for Python, with the following command in your terminal:
pip install Flask
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
2- Once you have Flask installed, create a new file called "app.py"      Here's the code for the application:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

This code creates a new Flask application, defines a single route for the root URL (/), and returns a "Hello, World!" message when that route is accessed.

3- Finally, the application is run if the script is being run directly (as supposed to being imported as a module).
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
4- To test the application locally, navigate to the directory containing app.py in your terminal and run the following command:
python app.py
This will start the Flask development server and make your application accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
If you visit that URL, you should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed.

That's it! You've just created and tested a simple Flask web application using Python.
